## Creature features

- They reproduce.
- They can die from starvation.
- Creatures can kill others.
- Ability to collect food and resources.
- The creature's profile contains information about their parents, ancestors, food, resources and real estate.

- 50% chance to obtain either "the father's aggressiveness" or the "mothers".
- The newborn always get random color and speed.
- The newborn's profile contains information about their parents, ancestors amd current generation.

You can move around/zoom with Orbital Controls, and click on every object to see information.
